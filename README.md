The project leverages Rasa, a conversational AI framework, to build the chatbot's conversational abilities, integrating it with Google's palm LLM API to enhance natural language understanding and response generation. Deployed on Flask, this backend structure ensures seamless interaction and data flow between the user and the AI model. The frontend is designed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Material-UI, prioritizing user-friendly interfaces and accessibility.
